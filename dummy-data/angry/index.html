                  I am awfully greedy; I want everything from life. I want to be a woman and to be a man, to have many friends and to have loneliness, to work much and write good books, to travel and enjoy myself, to be selfish and to be unselfishâ€¦ You see, it is difficult to get all which I want. And then when I do not succeed I get mad with anger

                  Bitterness is like cancer. It eats upon the host. But anger is like fire. It burns it all clean.

                  Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured.
